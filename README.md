local_manifests
===============

local manifest XMLs I use with the [repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html) script to build Android.  

NOTE TO ANY ONE READING THIS
----------------------------

*These should be used as a reference only!!*  
These are specific to my needs.  I build a customized version of [DirtyUnicorns](https://github.com/DirtyUnicorns/android_manifest) 10.0 for the LG G3 using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and my [Android builder](https://github.com/Thrilleratplay/docker-android-builder) project . Do not blindly use these for your own personal use.  Please fork and tailor to your own needs.
